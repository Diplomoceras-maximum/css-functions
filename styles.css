/* === CSS Functions === */

/*

    CSS functions are similar to programming languages in that they are reusable pieces of code that perform specific tasks

    Functions are passed "arguments" between brackets, some examples include::after
    1. rgb() / rgba ()
    2. linear-gradient()
    3. calc()
    4. min() / max()
    5. clamp()

    CSS does not allow the creation of custom functions, they are all premade

    Many CSS functions are important and useful for creating responsive design
